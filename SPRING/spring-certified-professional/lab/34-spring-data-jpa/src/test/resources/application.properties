# TO-DO-07 : Configure JPA
#
#   -   Define properties to make Spring Boot to run SQL
#       scripts (test-schema.sql and test-data.sql) located under
#       'rewards.testdb' directory
#
#   -   Define Spring Boot properties to make JPA show
#       the SQL it is running nicely formatted
#
#   -   Define a Spring Boot property to prevent hibernate
#       from auto-creating and auto-populating database tables,
#       our scripts did it already
#
#   -   Run RewardNetworkTests. Verify it succeeds.
#       (If you are using Gradle, comment out test exclude
#        statement from the build.gradle before running the test.)
